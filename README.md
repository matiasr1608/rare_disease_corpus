The dataset of 842 clinical records (labeled as rare or common) for research purposes and referencing correctly can be downloaded from this github repo.

In the repository, there is also a file containing a table of incorrect predictions (Table_wrongpredictions). For the LSTM model, these incorrect predictions are accompanied by comments from a rare disease specialist.
